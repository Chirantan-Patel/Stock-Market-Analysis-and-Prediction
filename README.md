# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction
## Introduction
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project on technical analysis, visualization, and prediction using data provided by Google Finance. By looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks and others. Used pandas to get stock information, visualized different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. Predicted future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to comparatively analyze the effectiveness of prediction algorithms on stock market data and get general insight on this data through visualization to predict future stock behavior and value at risk for each stock. The project encompasses the concept of Data Mining and Statistics. This project makes heavy use of NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries.

## In this analysis, I would like to explore the following questions.

### 1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?
